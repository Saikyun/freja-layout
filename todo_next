## TODO: Need to rethink sizing business.
## The things needed to rethink are:
## - What size should a row be?
## - What is the difference between "you shouldn't grow too big" vs "this is absolute max width"?
## -- E.g. a [:row {} [:block {} ...] [:block {} ...]]
## -- How big should the blocks become?
## -- Probably as small as the smallest children. Maybe.
## -- I should compare to CSS / HTML too...
